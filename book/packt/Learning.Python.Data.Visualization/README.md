Learning Python Data Visualization - Code Files
====================================

Here are the code files relating to the book, most of this project will use Python 2.7 32-bit either on Windows, Mac, or Ubuntu Linux.  In Chapter 8, Plotly's code base requires Python 3.4 or higher.

The HTTP iOS example requires XCode 5 with iOS 7 or higher. 
*(It's not required for learning the book, but serves as an example for HTTP)*

For data driven chapters keep in mind this was written in June 2014 so some of the code files may need to be tweaked for Packtpub's RSS feed, which only goes back two recent months.
